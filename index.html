                    I'm currently a third year student at Penn State University based in University Park, PA, pursuing a
                    double major in Computer Science and Digital Arts and Media Design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There has always been a part of me that yearns for artistic expression. When I entered college, I
                    only had plans to pursue a degree in Computer Science. However, after discovering the Digital Arts
                    and Media Design major, I knew it would be the perfect complement to both diversify my opportunities
                    and to help me pursue my personal interests in indie game and web development.
                </p>

            <div id="code" class="info">
                <p>
                    I consider myself a software developer first and foremost. I began coding in high school when a
                    teacher I was close to introduced me to HTML and CSS. But, if I'm going to be honest, I wasn't very
                    interested. It wasn't until I took an introductory Python course the following year that I truly
                    became hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, I have experience in scientific computing with Python, systems programming in C and Rust,
                    front-end development in JavaScript and frameworks like React, and am interested in everything
                    in-between. I'm passionate about open-source and hope to some day contribute to some of my favorite
                    projects, such as
                    <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot</a> or
                    <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevy</a>.

                    Digital art and design has always been an interest of mine. In fact, graphic design was my dream
                    profession as a child, and was a pretty serious hobby of mine for a few years. I have particular
                    interest in UI/UX design as well as 3D modeling, rendering, and computer graphics. My biggest dream
                    is to be a successful indie game developer, and I enjoy pursuing this as a hobby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite my passion for Computer Science, my education felt like it was missing something before my
                    double major. Digital design is integral to software development; software is, in the majority of
                    cases, written to be interacted with and understood by humans, and design is very much the
                    philosophy of how humans interact and understand.

                <p>
                    In my free time, I love to engage with music. Throughout my childhood, I studied piano, with an
                    interest in classical music. I have experimented in music production, and enjoy messing around with
                    my keyboard and listening to different sounds.

                    Someday I would also like to learn to play the guitar that I bought.
